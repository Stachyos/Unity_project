In my code structure (/Packages), all are the libraries that come with Unity when it is downloaded, which are necessary for runtime. Available at: https://unity.cn/releases ;
(/Assets) is the content I added after downloading. Among them, /Assets/Scripts is the code I wrote (including the part I modified based on GAI, as well as the rewritten classes that refer to the base classes), /Assets/Resources, /Assets/Addressable and /Assets/Animation are my prefabs, data and animations. All referenced code is in /Assets/Library, and all referenced game assets are in /Assets/Assets.
